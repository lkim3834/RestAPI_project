use SwaggerHub website along with this project 
1. Run "dotnet run watch" command and the SwaggerHub website would pop up 
2. Inside CharacterController.cs file, 
    - Get() function would get all character. 
    - GetSingle() function would get specific character with c.Id == id. SwaggerHub would require you to enter the id  (try 0 for Frodo and 1 for Sam)
    - AddCharacter() __ meant for the POST. try changing the name and id and execute on Swagger.
